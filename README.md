# 💫 About Me:
Hello, I’m Rasmus Bremholm. I am currently head of education @Tetiko specializing in Frontend Development and 3D modeling, both in Blender and CAD software. I am currently expanding my expertise into frontend development with a focus on Next.js.

My professional interests lie at the intersection of 3D design and web technology, where I aim to develop intuitive and visually compelling interfaces. Through my YouTube channel, I offer tutorials that bridge these two domains, sharing practical skills and industry insights.

For a glimpse into my latest projects and to view my developing portfolio, visit www.rasmusbremholm.com. Although still under construction, the site will soon reflect my growing body of work in web development.

If you’re keen on exploring innovative solutions at the nexus of design and technology, feel free to reach out. I’m eager to connect with like-minded professionals and contribute to exciting projects.
